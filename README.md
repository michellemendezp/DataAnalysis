# Workspace de Michelle

This project is a workspace for data analysis and machine learning using various tools like Python, Jupyter Notebook, and popular libraries. The repository is organized into  **Cheatsheets**  for quick references and  **Projects**  that demonstrate the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques.


## Folder Overview

### Cheatsheets Folder

This folder contains essential cheatsheets that will guide you through common data analysis tasks in  **Python**  and  **SQL**.

-   **[Pandas CheatSheet for Data Exploration](https://github.com/michellemendezp/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cheatsheets%20/CheatSheetPandas.ipynb)**  
    This cheat sheet is ideal for those transitioning from Excel to Python and Pandas, providing quick references for data manipulation tasks like indexing, grouping, and cleaning data.
    
-   **[SQL CheatSheet](https://github.com/michellemendezp/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cheatsheets%20/MySQL_CheatSheet.md)**  
    A guide to performing basic to advanced data queries in SQL  such as selecting, filtering, joining tables, and using window functions to explore and analyze data.
    

### Projects Folder

This folder showcases various data analysis and machine learning projects:

-   **[Linear Regression - Security Incident](https://github.com/michellemendezp/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Projects_/LinearRegression-SecurityIncident.ipynb)**  
    This project explores the use of linear regression in analyzing security incident data, using historical data to predict future trends and incident severity.
    
    
-   **[Data Treatment](https://github.com/michellemendezp/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Projects_/NSL-KDD_Project.ipynb)**  
    In this project, we prepare, split, and visualize the NSL-KDD dataset, applying Random Forest and K-Neighbors algorithms to classify network intrusion activities.
    
-   **[Amazon Sales Project](https://github.com/michellemendezp/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Projects_/AmazonSales_Project.ipynb)**  
    A project focused on cleaning and preparing raw Amazon sales data from India, with insights derived through data visualization.
    
-   **[Spotify Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/michellemendezp/DataAnalysis/tree/main/Projects_/Spotify%20Analysis)**  
    This project uses machine learning to predict track likability from Spotify data, analyzing features of songs to determine if they are liked or not.
    In this project I will also explore my own Spotify data, applying requests with the Spotify for developers API.
